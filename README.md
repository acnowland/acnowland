# Adam Nowland - Ex-Surgoen 👨‍⚕️ now Full Stack Software Developer 👨‍💻 

🤓 Full Stack Software engineer with a love for creating applications that affect peoples lives. My prior medical degree offers me insight into 
user driven experiences and the need for applications with a focus on ease-of-access to users.

💡 Passionate about finding unique solutions to complicated problems and bringing a unique point of view to any problem solving approach. I look at every
coding problem in the same manner I analyzed complex medical conditions.
